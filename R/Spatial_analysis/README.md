# STEAM Spatial Anchor Analysis - Complete Organization Guide

### Core Purpose
The method identifies and corrects misclassified cells by using high-confidence cells as "spatial anchors" to guide corrections of nearby uncertain cells, without requiring ground truth validation data.

### Scientific Logic

#### The Spatial Anchor Concept
- **Spatial Anchors**: High-confidence cells that serve as reference points for nearby corrections
- **Biological Basis**: Cells in close spatial proximity often belong to the same cell type due to tissue organization
- **Expression Validation**: Gene expression similarity provides additional evidence for corrections

#### Key Biological Principles
1. **Spatial Coherence**: Adjacent cells in tissue sections typically share cell type identity
2. **Expression Consistency**: Cells of the same type exhibit similar gene expression patterns  
3. **Confidence Weighting**: High-confidence predictions are more likely to be correct
4. **Consensus Voting**: Multiple spatial anchors reduce correction errors through voting

### Analysis Workflow

```
1. Compute Baseline Metrics
   - (Spatial coherence, expression coherence, model confidence)
   
2. Identify Uncertain Cells  
   - (Low confidence + spatial inconsistency + expression mismatch)
   
3. Find Spatial Anchors
   - (High-confidence cells in neighborhoods)
   
4. Generate Corrections via Consensus
   - (Anchor voting with spatial/expression validation)
   
5. Apply Conservative Corrections
   - (Only high-confidence improvements)
   
6. Iterate Until Convergence
   - (Repeat with updated predictions)
   
7. Track & Validate Improvements
```

### Mathematical Framework

#### Confidence Scoring
- **Spatial Confidence**: Agreement with k-nearest spatial neighbors
- **Expression Confidence**: Correlation with same-type cells  
- **Model Confidence**: Original classifier probability scores
- **Combined Score**: Weighted combination of all confidence measures

#### Correction Criteria
- **Consensus Threshold**: Minimum agreement among spatial anchors (typically >70%)
- **Improvement Threshold**: Minimum spatial/expression improvement required
- **Conservative Application**: Only corrections with high confidence are applied

### Key Advantages

1. **No Ground Truth Required**: Works without validation labels
2. **Conservative Approach**: Minimizes false corrections through multiple validation steps  
3. **Iterative Improvement**: Progressively refines predictions over multiple rounds
4. **Biologically Informed**: Leverages spatial tissue organization principles
5. **Comprehensive Validation**: Uses spatial, expression, and model confidence
