#### Below are several major steps of running STEAM:

``` r
# Create a new STEAM object for the loaded spatial transcriptomic data
STEAM.Obj <- LoadSTEAM(count_exp = matrix, spatial = coordinates, labels = labels, Seurat.obj = NULL)
```

``` r
STEAM.Obj <- RunSTEAM(STEAM.obj, train.ratio = 0.8, n.size = 5, seed = 123, cv.folds = 10, cv.repeats = 3, trainval.ratio = 0.8, model = "rf", n.tree = 500, kernel = 'linear', train.folder.name = 'train.out', allowParallel = FALSE)

```
