## Installation

You can install the STEAM Package from
[GitHub](https://github.com/fanzhanglab/STEAM/) using the devtools as
follows:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fanzhanglab/STEAM")
```
(OR)

``` r
remotes::install_github("fanzhanglab/STEAM")
```
<br/>

### Dependencies / Other required packages

- R (\>= 4.2)
- ggplot2 (\>= 3.4.2)

## Tutorials

**Step-by-step notebook** of applying STEAM on 10X Visium Human Brain Data (DLPFC):

<br/>

#### Below are several major steps of running STEAM:

``` r
# Create a new STEAM object for the loaded spatial transcriptomic data
STEAM = STEAM_Obj(count = dlpfc$count_exp,
                  spatial = dlpfc$spatial)
```
... (skip several preprocessing steps) ...

``` r

STEAM <- RunSTEAM(x = STEAM$exp_adj_matrix, z = STEAM$adj_matrix, obj = STEAM, nperms=50, niter=3)
```


<br/>
