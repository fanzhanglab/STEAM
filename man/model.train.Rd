\item{kernel}{Kernel type for SVM ("linear" or "radial").}

\item{cv.folds}{Number of CV folds (simple mode).}

\item{n_outer_folds}{Number of outer folds (nested mode).}

\item{n_inner_folds}{Number of inner folds (nested mode).}

\item{metric}{Optimization metric for caret (e.g. "Accuracy", "Kappa").}

\item{tune.grid}{Optional tuning grid.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to caret or nestedcv.}

\code{STEAM.obj$train}.
}
\description{
Trains classification models (Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, or Multinomial
Logistic Regression) for STEAM, supporting both simple and nested
cross-validation. This function is called internally by \code{\link{RunSTEAM}}
and is not intended for direct use by package users.
