\usage{
.guess_coord_names(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Training matrix (samples Ã— features), with rownames = cell IDs.}

\item{y}{(Unused, present for modeling API compatibility).}

\item{coords_all}{Data frame of spatial coordinates, rownames = cell IDs.}

\item{n.size}{Integer, neighborhood radius (in coordinate units).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"neighavg_fit"} containing training
data and coordinate mappings.
}
\description{
Provides a custom modeling adapter used by STEAM during nested CV.
This object modifies feature matrices by averaging feature values
across spatial neighbors, based on coordinates and a neighborhood size.
}
\details{
Users should not call these functions directly. They are called internally
when \code{\link{RunSTEAM}} is executed with spatial neighborhood options.
