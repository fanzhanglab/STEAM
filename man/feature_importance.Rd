\title{Plot Top Feature Importances from a Trained STEAM Model}
\usage{
feature_importance(
  STEAM.obj,
  top_n = 10,
  title = "Top Features by Importance",
  nested_fold = "best"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{STEAM.obj}{A trained STEAM object containing a model in \code{train$model},
or nested CV results in \code{nested$ncv}.}

\item{top_n}{Integer, number of top features to display. Defaults to 10.}

\item{title}{Character, plot title. Defaults to \code{"Top Features by Importance"}.}

\item{nested_fold}{Either an integer indicating which outer fold to use, or
\code{"best"} (default) to automatically choose the fold with highest Kappa.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector of feature importance scores (invisibly).
A barplot of the top features is also printed.
}
\description{
Computes and plots variable importance scores from a trained STEAM model,
using \pkg{caret} variable importance or model-specific coefficients when
available. Supports Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and multinomial logistic regression.
