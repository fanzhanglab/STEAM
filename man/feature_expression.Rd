\title{Plot Feature Expression Across Layers or Labels}
\usage{
feature_expression(
  steam_obj,
  feature_name,
  view = c("pooled", "facet"),
  title = "Expression Across Layers"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{steam_obj}{A STEAM object containing expression matrix, labels, and
optionally nested CV results.}

\item{feature_name}{Character string, name of the feature (row name in
\code{count_exp}) to plot.}

\item{view}{Character, either \code{"pooled"} (all folds together) or
\code{"facet"} (separate panels by outer fold). Defaults to \code{"pooled"}.}

\item{title}{Character, plot title.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object (invisibly). The plot is also printed.
}
\description{
Visualizes the expression of a given feature (e.g., gene, protein) across
layers or labels in a STEAM object. Supports pooled plotting across folds
or faceted plotting by outer CV fold.

\examples{
\dontrun{
data(DLPFC)

                      model = "rf", cv.cores = 2)
