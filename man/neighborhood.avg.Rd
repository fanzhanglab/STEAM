\title{Internal: Neighborhood Averaging for STEAM Objects}
\usage{
neighborhood.avg(STEAM.obj, n.size, is_train)
}
\arguments{
\item{STEAM.obj}{A STEAM object containing training and/or test data.}

\item{n.size}{Numeric, neighborhood radius (coordinate units).}

\item{is_train}{Logical, whether to apply to training (\code{TRUE}) or
test (\code{FALSE}) data.}
}
\value{
The updated STEAM object with an added \code{avg.matrix} in
\code{$train} or \code{$test}.
}
\description{
Applies local spatial neighborhood averaging to training or test data
within a STEAM object. For each cell, expression profiles are replaced
with the mean of all neighbors within an \code{n.size} window in X/Y
coordinates (if at least two neighbors are found).
