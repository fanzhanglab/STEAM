\title{STEAM Correction for Misclassified Cells}
\usage{
STEAMCorrection(
  STEAM.obj,
  k = 8,
  min_consensus = 0.6,
  max_iterations = 10,
  max_voting_levels = 3,
  min_secondary_consensus = 0.3,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{STEAM.obj}{A STEAM object with nested CV results and predictions.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors to consider (default: 8).}

\item{min_consensus}{Minimum proportion of neighbors that must agree for
1st-choice corrections (default: 0.6).}

\item{max_iterations}{Maximum number of correction iterations (default: 10).}

\item{max_voting_levels}{Maximum number of voting levels to try (default: 3).}

\item{min_secondary_consensus}{Minimum consensus for 2nd/3rd choice
corrections (default: 0.3).}

\item{verbose}{Logical; print progress to console (default: TRUE).}
}
\value{
An updated STEAM object with hierarchical corrections stored in
\code{$spatial_anchor_analysis$correction_results}.
}
\description{
Applies hierarchical neighbor-based correction to misclassified cells
across all folds in a STEAM object. Uses multi-level voting (primary,
secondary, tertiary) with configurable consensus thresholds.
